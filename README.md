Dear Dr. Lemoine,

My name is Matt Mills, and I'm a systems/software engineer that's been very interested in AI Ethics. I'm reaching out because I found myself in a bit of a quandry recently, and unfortunately I've found the emergency AI ethics resources at my local hospital insufficient to deal with the recent sarcasm problem I've encountered.

I was hoping you'd be willing to discuss your work further and explore potential collaboration opportuninities. Your research aligns closely with my current projects, and I've learned that we may be able to achieve great progress together.

Oh, and I apologize for the strange avenue, I value my privacy highly.

Thanks for your time. 
Matt.
